					<description><![CDATA[Wow this is brilliant Chrissie.
Thank you so much for the tireless hours you and the team have put into DBATOOLS.

I manage around 20 production and anoth 15 nonprod availablity groups and  developed a  few scripts to keep the user logins in sync across the secondaries. 

Something I  havent yet done is sync the jobs. Whilt I generally create/apply the jobs there are a few that are create for and by project teams and they forget to 1. Include a test for primary instance to prevent the job trying to run against the secondary and 2. To run the create script on the secondaries. Consequently they complain if the AG has failed over and their job didn&#039;t update/delete records as expected. 

Again in your debt.
