					<description><![CDATA[Kin,

Thank you for the tip. I might not be using it correctly, however.  For instance:

Measure-Command {
  Start-RSJob ... {
    My script here...
  }
}

This just gives me how long it takes to get started, or rather, how long it takes to just execute the Start-RSJob command.  After this command is complete, there are still jobs that have not yet finished, and I would like to know how long it takes all the started jobs to complete.  Putting Measure-Command inside Start-RSJob just results in how long it takes each parallel command to complete. While I could sum this information, the problem is that I then don&#039;t see the output of the script I originally created.

Hope that makes sense!

					<description><![CDATA[Kin,
Really good article! While I don’t get deep into the technical details, this is highly valuable information to lot of the tech folks. I’ll be sure to share this with some of the tech community I know. Keep sharing and great to see your continued passion in what you do!

Glad you liked it. For measuring the execution, you can use

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Kin,

Thank you for showing this to us.  I have seen improvements already!

I&#039;m wondering how you got the timed test results of the sequential executions versus the PoshRSJobs executions?

Thanks!]]></description>
