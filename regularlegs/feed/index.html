					<description><![CDATA[Hey Thomas,
We chose the Dba prefix because Microsoft owns the Sql prefix, and we don&#039;t want to encounter naming conflicts. 

We were having a lot of discussions like &quot;Should we name this Get-DbaProcess or Get-DbaSqlProcess? *Everything* can potentially be DbaSql, so removing the potential for anything being DbaSql kept things consistent.

Perhaps my wording is wrong, but my brain is too broken to update. Please suggest an update to the sentence if you&#039;re up for it.

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot for your updates!, one thing is very, very strange. You have made this change:

&quot;DbaSql has been changed to just Dba, no exceptions. Think of Dba as &quot;Sql&quot;.&quot;

I hope you had a very important reason to not call &quot;Sql&quot; as Sql (e.g. it&#039;s was impossible to give it the right name or a name which implies to be an Sql).

In the last 30 years, I never had a situation where it was a good idea to name something and then commet: &quot;Think of Apple as Pear.&quot;

Kind regards, all the best!
