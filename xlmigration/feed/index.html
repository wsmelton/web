					<description><![CDATA[Andy, great job. I am thinking of applying your method to move around 1500 databases to new server. In your description above you mentioned about Get-MountProgress. Do you have the script for that?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, the new server was set up as a completely new box. New hostname, new IP, everything. The old server was not taken offline/powered off/removed from the rack for about 3 weeks after the migration was completed. The issue with the app is that it had a connection string embedded in the code which we were not aware of.

In some respects it would have been easier if we could have kept the same hostname and IP, but that was not an option for this project.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Andy, great post and scripts.  I&#039;m new to powershell, but was curious about your approach to the common and complex  migration challenge.  In your scenario, you mentioned some apps were still pointing to the old server.  Did you have to create a new DNS for the destination server instead of changing the IP for alias?]]></description>
