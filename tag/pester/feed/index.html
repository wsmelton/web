T-SQL Tuesday is the brainchild of Adam Machanic. It is a blog party on the second Tuesday of each month. Everyone is welcomed to participate.</p>
<p>This month’s T-SQL Tuesday, hosted by Arun Sirpal (<a href=https://blobeater.blog>[b]</a>|<a href=https://twitter.com/blobeater1>[t]</a>), is all about overcoming technical challenges.</div><div class='clear_column'></div></p>
<h3>The challenge</h3>
<p>I always try to solve my technical issues with natively available (aka Microsoft) solutions. It&#8217;s one of the many reasons I love PowerShell.</p>
<p>When it comes to monitoring, I know there are some really wonderful solutions out there. <a href="https://www.sentryone.com/sql-server/database-monitoring-tools">SentryOne</a> and <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/database-performance-monitoring-software">SolarWinds</a> come to mind but I don&#8217;t always need deep query level monitoring or I may not be able to pay licencing costs for all of my SQL Instances. But I do need to easily know if they are all set up correctly.</p>
<p>Ever since I was a baby DBA, I&#8217;ve wanted to create a centralized solution that I could roll in with and get going with after finding all of my servers. Over the years, I&#8217;ve tried to put together some ASP/VBScript solutions, then when I learned PowerShell, tried PowerShell and SQL Agent, but I just wasn&#8217;t feeling it. I could never figure out how to make the checks modular and universal. That is, until I learned about <a href="https://sqldbawithabeard.com/2017/11/16/write-your-first-pester-test-today/">Pester</a> in-depth from <a href="https://sqldbawithabeard.com/">Rob Sewell</a>.</p>
<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>The solution I&#8217;ve been looking for turns out to be a mix of dbatools and Pester. Pester is the first Open Source community project formally included in a Windows release! Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 include Pester by default.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Pester/Pester/wiki/"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/dbatools.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pester-med-logo.png?resize=312%2C122&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="312" height="122" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6917" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/dbatools.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pester-med-logo.png?w=312&amp;ssl=1 312w, https://i2.wp.com/dbatools.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pester-med-logo.png?resize=300%2C117&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Pester makes it easy to standardize tests or &#8220;checks&#8221; because it can output its results in a number of standardized formats, including NunitXml and JSON. It&#8217;s all PowerShell, after all.</p>
<p>dbatools makes it easy to perform these checks without installing additional software or stored procedures on each of my servers. I have one central workstation that needs to be updated and checking hundreds of servers is as easy as checking just one.</p>
<p>So after poring over Rob&#8217;s prodigious <a href="https://github.com/SQLDBAWithABeard/Presentations">GitHub Presentation Repository</a>, I found a bunch of his tests, and added them to a newly created module. I then created an index of the checks to make them easy to access. Once I got the proof of concept down, I invited a few people from the community who I know are involved in Pester and asked them to help.</p>
<p>The result has been a dream come true!</p>
<h3>Index</h3>
<p>Index of checks. You can run them all, run by group or only run the specific tests that matter to your environment.</p>

<p>We are still working on the checks, but these screenshots should give you an idea about the new SQL PowerShell module that Rob and I will be premiering at our <a href="https://sqlps.io/bitsprecon">SQLBits PowerShell Precon</a>, <code>Reliable, Repeatable, &amp; Automated: PowerShell for DBAs</code>, in London on Thursday, February 22 2018.</p>
