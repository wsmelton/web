					<description><![CDATA[Would be nice, however version 1.0.29, when ever I run any of the SPN tools I always get &quot;AD lookup failure. This may be because the domain cannot be resolved for the SQL Server service account (BXXXXC\SRVC_SSE_XXXX_XXX)&quot;, it even fails to find the service account under the SAM name &quot;Searching for SRVC_SSE_XXXX_XXX under domain BXXXXX in SamAccountName format&quot; I have checked the account and yes it&#039;s SAM name is exactly spelled as stated in the text statement. How can I find out if it&#039;s a possible permissions issue, I have enabled the verbose logging and unable to identify anything there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very helpfull tool as dbatools generally. 
You explain that next version will manage SSIS SPN. 
Is it already done ? 
And if not, do you now which prefix to use with SSIS ? (for SQL db engine it&#039;s MSSQLSvc/). 

Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very nice tool.  One thing I would recommend is to check if any instances discovered are actually online.  I&#039;m in the middle of retiring a number of instances.  The services are stopped and disabled, but they report back as SPN Missing in the tool.  If an instance is not running, should it have an SPN?  :)]]></description>
