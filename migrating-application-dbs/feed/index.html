					<description><![CDATA[Is there a way for the command to use the credential that I give it instead of the service account for the backup/restore?

Unfortunately, our systems are so segregated they don&#039;t share directories, nor do they share a service account.  Since I am trying to copy databases in the same environment I have access with my DBA credentials, but they don&#039;t seem to be used anywhere I need them to be used (aka the file system to access the .bak).

I was surprised it was using the service account not the one I provided for -DestinationSqlCredential/-SourceSqlCredential

Here is the warning:
WARNING: [15:48:47][Test-DbaBackupInformation] Backup File \\SERVERA\backup$\A_DB_201910221548-2-of-3.bak cannot
be read by SERVERB. Does the service account (TSTDOMAIN\SERVERBSVCACCT) have permission?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a very good function, but one question, if my destination db needs to be a different folder (from the source db folder), is this doable?
An example is:
source db: X_DB, two files d:\data\x.mdf and e:\log\x.ldf

want to restore to destination db as follows
destination db: Y_DB, two files M:\data\x.mdf and N:\log\x.ldf

is this doable? (also assume M:\Data\ and N:\Log\ are NOT the default db paths at the destination server side)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Michael,

You can&#039;t backup and restore from new to old, as you have discovered. The only way to do that would be as you say moving data. dbatools can help you with this, it has commands to copy table data and generate scripts. Copy-DbaDbTableData, Export-DbaScript. Or if you have an older compatible backup you could restore that (then maybe merge everything). BUT - it sounds like you have your database on a newer version of SQL now, can&#039;t you just keep it there?

If for some reason you want to keep new and old, can&#039;t think why but who knows. You could use SQL server replication to keep the old server in sync with the new server (assuming its not more than 2 versions older, I think it&#039;s 2 version max jump for replication)

Good Luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jess,

These tools are fabulous.  Thanks for all of the hard work of you and your team.

I&#039;m trying to migrate a database from a newer SQL server to an older one.  Unfortunately, I don&#039;t have the option to change the version of SQL server in use. 

When I attempt to do a restoration of the backup, I get an error saying that it&#039;s incompatible.  Is there a way around this short if using a script to call through each table and copy everything row for row?

Michael]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Todd,
Glad you are using dbatools for that process! For bring production data down to non-prod I would use something similar to this process, you could also look at `Invoke-DbaDbDataMasking` to mask any sensitive data (https://docs.dbatools.io/#Invoke-DbaDbDataMasking). There is also a post on scheduling dbatools scripts that might help if you wanted to run it automagically https://dbatools.io/agent/.
Thanks for stopping by,
Jess]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I&#039;ve just begun the process of migrating / consolidating our many instances on 2 new clusters with dbatools as my goto tool.

I have one case where developers want to bring a prod database down to stage and dev on a regular basis, copying over the existing databases each time. Can you recommend a process using dbatools?]]></description>
