					<description><![CDATA[We are currently migrating 155 servers from 2005 ( I know I know. Don&#039;t start) to SQL 2017.

We wrote all of the migration using powershell and dbatools.

It&#039;s comforting to read your post and, more or less, see that we did the same thing (Lets me know we might be doing something right :) ) 

Oddly enough we ran into the SSPI issues also and it stalled our upgrade for a bit. It would have been nice to found out the setting that was changed because we checked the SPNs and could not find anything glaringly wrong... :/ We had this happen a couple of times in our non-prod testing environment and we&#039;ve just deleted the SPN and we were good but that didn&#039;t seem to be the case here.

All that aside, thank you for you damn good work on this module. It honestly the best tool I use every single day. Be proud and keep on keeping on.

Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We did a migration once where we did not know column level encryption was in use. So the night of the migration no one knew the password to the cert/key and we could not encrypt/decrypt this column. 

Needless to say the application would not function correctly. 

Luckily, my boss was online and he wipped up a script to decrypt the data on the old server and re-encrypt on the new server. 

So he saved the day and I did an audit the following week to make sure we knew where encryption was in use.]]></description>
